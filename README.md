Got a sticky notes and random scribbles all over your workspace? This application can help with all that! This Task Board can help you assign new tasks with due dates to keep you conscious of when certain items are due.  Just give it a title, due date, and a brief description, then you can post it under "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done"!

## Usage

Click on the "Add Task" button at the top of the page. A pop-up box will appear asking for information such as the title, due date, and description of the task you would like to add. After filling the form out just click the green "Add Task" button at the bottom of the form and a task card will show up under the "to-do" column. As the deadline for your task approaches the card will change color. Orange: due date the current day. Red: the task is past due. White: you haven't reach the due date yet. Drag the card to the next few columns if the task is i progress or it has been completed. Delete the task card by clicking on the delete button once you are ready to clear out the task!
